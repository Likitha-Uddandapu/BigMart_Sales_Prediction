# BigMart_Sales_Prediction
This project predicts BigMart sales using XGBoost, feature engineering, and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. It includes data cleaning, encoding, scaling, and model evaluation for accuracy. ðŸš€

I worked on an exciting BigMart Sales Prediction project using XGBoost and advanced feature engineering techniques. Hereâ€™s what I explored:

ðŸ“Œ Fixed Data Inconsistencies:
âœ… Replaced "lf" with "Low Fat" and "reg" with "Regular" for consistency.

ðŸ“Œ Feature Engineering:
âœ… Created Outlet Age to capture store impact.
âœ… Built an Item_Weight_MRP feature to understand price-weight relationships.
âœ… Applied log transformation for smoother data distribution.

ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning Model:
âœ… Used XGBoost Regressor for predictions.
âœ… Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to reduce RMSE.
âœ… Ensured no negative sales predictions.
